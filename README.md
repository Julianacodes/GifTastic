# GifTastic

##Overview
I made a dynamic web page using GIPHY API that populates Disney characters giphs.

##Full Break Down
* Please select one of the Disney character buttons to see some giphs of that character. 
* In order to make the giphy play, please click on it. 
* To stop the giphy from playing, please click on it again. 
* You can also enter a disney character in the search box if you would like to search for other Disney character gifs. 
* Once you submit a character a button will populate for you with that character name. 
* If you click submit without inputting a name, an alert will let you know to enter a characters name to search.
